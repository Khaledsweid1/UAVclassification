# UAVclassification
ResNet 18 model for air vehicles classification
The model classifies an input image for an aerial vehicle into one of the following classes: airplane, helicopter, and drone. The model was trained on a small dataset due to hardware limitations. It was not bad for the first trial with CNNs. 
In order to run this model on you laptop/pc, all what you have to do is run the predict script after adding the path to the input image in the last 3 lines of the predict.py script.Note that you have also to install the requirements.
